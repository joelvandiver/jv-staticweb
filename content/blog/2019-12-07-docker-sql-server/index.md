Setting up SQL SERVER on a Docker Container is so ***easy*** that I cringe at all of the times that I have installed a full-blown SQL SERVER instance on my systems in the past.  

> What used to take a few hours with several touch points, now just takes a couple of commands and a few mins.

Also, since this is on Docker, SQL SERVER is fully isolated from the rest of my system.

## Let's Get This Done

Install the latest with `docker pull`:

```powershell
docker pull mcr.microsoft.com/mssql/server:2017-latest
```

Set the SA password:

```powershell
docker run -e "ACCEPT_EULA=Y" -e "SA_PASSWORD=<YourStrong@Passw0rd>" `
   -p 1433:1433 --name sql1 `
   -d mcr.microsoft.com/mssql/server:2017-latest
```

Now, you are free to connect to it with **sqlcmd**, or you can connect directly from SQL SERVER Management Studio:

![docker-sql-login](./docker-sql-login.png)

Be sure to use the `hostname` as the **Server name**.

> This entire setup took 5 mins and is amazingly simple!
