[Fable](https://fable.io/) is a transpiler of F# source code to JavaScript just as TypeScript transpiles down to JavaScript.

Let's take [Fable](https://fable.io/) out for a spin and create a simple `canvas` drawing of a cirle with an F# script.

<canvas id="fable-drawing"></canvas>
<script src="/assets/js/scripts/fable-fsx.js"></script>

## Prereqs

> Setup the following dependencies (other than F#) on your system:

- Node & NPM
- Paket (Nuget)

## Let's Draw!

- Create a new directory, `/fable-fsx`
- Open `/fable-fsx` in your terminal
- Add a `test.html` with the following `canvas` and `script`:

```
<canvas id="fable-drawing" ...
<script src="./fable-fsx.js" ...
```

- Add a `paket.dependencies` with the following contents:

```
source https://api.nuget.org/v3/index.json

nuget Fable.Import.Browser
nuget Fable.Core
```

- Run `paket install`
- Add the following `fable.fsx` file.

```fsharp
#r @".\packages\Fable.Core\lib\netstandard2.0\Fable.Core.dll"
#r @".\packages\Fable.Import.Browser\lib\netstandard1.6\Fable.Import.Browser.dll"

open Fable.Core.JsInterop
open Fable.Import.Browser

let tile = 200.
let scale = 0.5

let canvas = document.getElementById("fable-drawing") :?> HTMLCanvasElement
canvas.width  <- tile
canvas.height <- tile
let ctx = canvas.getContext_2d()
(canvas, ctx)

let r = scale / 2. * tile
let x = tile / 2.
ctx.strokeStyle <- !^"#aaa"
ctx.beginPath()
ctx.arc(x, x, r, 0., 360.)
ctx.stroke()
```

- Add the following web.config.js 

```javascript
var path = require("path");

module.exports = {
    mode: "development",
    entry: "./fable.fsx",
    output: {
        path: path.join(__dirname, "./"),
        filename: "fable-fsx.js",
    },
    devServer: {
        contentBase: "./",
        port: 8080,
    },
    module: {
        rules: [{
            test: /\.fs(x|proj)?$/,
            use: "fable-loader"
        }]
    }
}
```

- Run `npm init`
- Add the following lines to a `package.json`

```json
  ...
  "devDependencies": {
    "@babel/core": "^7.7.7",
    "fable-compiler": "^2.4.11",
    "fable-loader": "^2.1.8",
    "webpack": "^4.41.4",
    "webpack-cli": "^3.3.10"
  },
  "scripts": {
    "build": "webpack --config webpack.config.js --mode production"
  },
  ...
```

- Run `npm install`
- Run `npm run build`
- Load the `test.html` in a browser

## To Transpile or Not To Transpile

After going through this bootstrap of a Fable canvas example, it is worth reflecting whether this was worth it.  

If the objective was to simply draw a circle in canvas then going through all of this was overkill.  However, most of the work was environmental in nature.  We can reuse all of the setup for future Fable projects on our system, and we get the functional, type-safe experience with F#.
