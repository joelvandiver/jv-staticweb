# NASA APOD

I wanted to add something interesting to my blog, and then I remembered that NASA has an astronomy picture of the day (APOD).

[https://api.nasa.gov/](https://api.nasa.gov/)

After requesting my own api key, I was able to issue GET requests to get the photo of the day: `fetch("https://api.nasa.gov/planetary/apod?api_key={API_KEY}")`.

Here's a sample from today's response:

> Json

```json
{
   "date": "2019-09-04",
   "explanation": "Will the spider ever catch the fly? Not if both are large emission nebulas toward the constellation of the Charioteer (Auriga).  The spider-shaped gas cloud on the left is actually an emission nebula labelled IC 417, while the smaller fly-shaped cloud on the right is dubbed  NGC 1931 and is both an emission nebula and a reflection nebula.  About 10,000 light-years distant, both nebulas harbor young, open star clusters. For scale, the more compact NGC 1931 (Fly) is about 10 light-years across. The featured picture in scientifically-assigned, infrared colors combines images from the Spitzer Space Telescope and the Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS).  Spitzer is celebrating its 16th year orbiting the Sun near the Earth.

   "hdurl": "https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/1909/SpiderFly_Spitzer2Mass_4165.jpg",
   "media_type": "image",
   "service_version": "v1",
   "title": "The Spider Nebula in Infrared",
   "url": "https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/1909/SpiderFly_Spitzer2Mass_960.jpg"
}
```

With that response, I simply need to extract the url and create an `img` element when the `media_type === "image"`.

Here's the full example:

> Html

```html
<div id="nasa-img-container"></div>
```

> JavaScript

```javascript
(function () {
    fetch("https://api.nasa.gov/planetary/apod?api_key={API_KEY}")
        .then(function (response) {
            return response.json();
        })
        .then(function (json) {
            if (!json.media_type === "image") { return; }
            var src = json.url;
            var container = document.getElementById("nasa-img-container");
            var img = document.createElement('img');
            img.src = src;
            container.title = json.explanation;
            container.appendChild(img);
        });
})();
```

Here's my favorite photo I've found in APOD so far:
