# F# Option

Option values in F# provide the ability to decribe a value as either `Some` or `None`.  Typically, in imperative languages such as C#, `null` is used to convey the same meaning.  However, the use of `null` may also indicate other procedural meanings such as "incomplete" or "not yet".  This overloading of meaning creates ambiguity.  



> Returning option values from functions requires the caller to handle the None case.


```fsharp
let workOnOptionalValue data = 
    if data = "Do Work" then Some "Work was done."
    else None

let workIsDone = workOnOptionalValue "Do Work"
let workIsNone = workOnOptionalValue "No work"
```


> Returning null values does not require the caller to handle the null case.

```fsharp
let workOnNullValue data = 
    if data = "Do Work" then "Work was done."
    else null

let workIsDoneAmbiguous = workOnNullValue "Do Work"
let workIsNullAmbiguous = workOnNullValue "No work"
```

> Output:
```fsharp
val workOnNullValue : data:string -> string
val workIsDoneAmbiguous : string = "Work was done."
val workIsNullAmbiguous : string = null
```


> A null reference exception will occur when the caller operates on a null value.


```fsharp
let willRaiseException = workIsNullAmbiguous.Length = 7
```

Option values can be extracted with pattern matching.
