# Reflection in Leadership

> True leadership requires reflection.  

Recently, I found myself in a defensive position, and my response was honestly **subpar**.  I would not have come to this conclusion without reflection, and I am convinced that reflection is essential to good leadership.

## Issues

In software engineering, developers need to consistently raises issues.  Issues can range from actual software defects to problems in tooling, processes, or requirements.  Indeed, a software developer's job can be simply defined as *the raising and closing of issues*.

## Conflict

This fact of software engineering undoubtly will lead to conflict.  One deverloper may raise an issue on another developer's work, and this will likely put the other developer into a defensive position.  

One developer on my team raised such an issue.  The issue being raised wasn't totally in my control, so I responded with "You can *gripe* to me but I'll just have to relay that *gripe* to the business side."  This use of the word *gripe* was **wrong** of me.  

## Forbidden Word: ~~Gripe~~

I have come to the conclusion that this word should be off limits or at least we should tread lightly when using it.  The word, "*Gripe*", conveys a negative sense of grumbling about issues.  Raises issues is our job as software engineers. 

## Preferred Word: Concern

Addressing another's concerns reflects positively upon the raising of the issue and promotes a positive team environment.  Instead of saying, "Your *gripe* about ...", we should say, "Your *concern* about ..."

## P.S. Grumbling

If a developer is actually grumbling about issues (which can occur from time to time), then start by addressing the grumbling in a one-on-one session with that developer.  This doesn't have to be confrontational in nature; seek to get to the root of the problem with that developer.
